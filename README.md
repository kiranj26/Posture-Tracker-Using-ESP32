## Phase 1 — Sensor Axis Map (verified on real hardware, 2026-04-25)

This axis map was confirmed by physically tilting the sensor on a breadboard.
Raw values are at ±2g range (16384 LSB = 1g). Sensor was sitting at ~45° on
breadboard so az at rest reads ~10940 instead of 16384 — normal, calibration
handles this in Phase 4.

### Confirmed axis orientations

| Movement | Axis | Direction | Typical raw value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Flat on desk | az | positive | ~10940 |
| Tilt toward you — takeoff / nose up | ay | large positive | ~+7300 |
| Tilt away from you — landing / nose down | ay | large negative | ~-6800 |
| Tilt left | ax | large positive | ~+6500 |
| Tilt right | ax | large negative | ~-8000 |

### Quick reference

```
ax large +  →  tilted LEFT
ax large -  →  tilted RIGHT
ay large +  →  tilted TOWARD you  (takeoff / nose up)
ay large -  →  tilted AWAY        (landing / nose down)
az ~10000   →  sitting flat on breadboard
```

## Phase 2 — Angle Output (verified on real hardware, 2026-04-25)

Sensor sitting at the same ~45° breadboard angle from Phase 1.
EMA filter (alpha=0.15) applied. Resting values are non-zero by design —
Phase 4 calibration will capture these as baseline.

### Resting values (sensor still on breadboard)
```
pitch ≈ +1.3°  roll ≈ +0.2°   (fluctuation < ±0.3°)
```

### Verified angle ranges

| Movement | Axis | Direction | Observed range | Pass threshold |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tilt left | pitch | large positive | up to **+86°** | >10° |
| Tilt right | pitch | large negative | down to **-87°** | >10° |
| Nose up (takeoff) | roll | large positive | up to **+176°** | >10° |
| Nose down (landing) | roll | large negative | down to **-86°** | >10° |

### Quick reference
```
pitch large +  →  tilted LEFT
pitch large -  →  tilted RIGHT
roll  large +  →  nose up  (takeoff)
roll  large -  →  nose down (landing)
```

### Filter behaviour
- Convergence after tilt release: ~10–15 samples (1–1.5 seconds) ✅
- At-rest noise floor: < ±0.3° ✅

### Raw data sample — sensor at rest
```
I (9591) MAIN: pitch=   1.65  roll=   0.47
I (9691) MAIN: pitch=   1.73  roll=   0.26
I (9791) MAIN: pitch=   1.72  roll=   0.25
```

### Raw data sample — tilt left (pitch large positive)
```
I (16591) MAIN: pitch=  37.51  roll=   0.07
I (16691) MAIN: pitch=  39.49  roll=   0.15
I (16791) MAIN: pitch=  41.74  roll=   0.26
```

### Raw data sample — tilt right (pitch large negative)
```
I (26591) MAIN: pitch= -63.62  roll=   1.35

```

## Phase 5 — Full Integration (verified on real hardware, 2026-04-26)

Three FreeRTOS tasks running concurrently:
- **Task A (IMU, Core 0, prio 5):** reads angles every 100ms, writes to `g_imu_data` under mutex, sets event group bit
- **Task B (FSM, Core 0, prio 4):** blocks on event group, evaluates posture state machine, enqueues audio commands
- **Task C (Audio, Core 1, prio 3):** blocks on queue, dispatches tone sequences and WAV playback

### Escalation sequence when in BAD state

| Time in BAD | Audio |
|---|---|
| Entry | Double beep |
| +8s | Double beep (escalation 2) |
| +16s | Double beep (escalation 3) |
| +24s onwards | "Sit up straight" voice clip, repeating every 8s until corrected |

Correcting posture at any point → 2-note confirm tone → RESET → GOOD.

### Key implementation notes
- WAV playback switches I2S clock to 16kHz then back to 44.1kHz — prevents chipmunk effect
- WAV embedded as C array (`sit_up_wav.c`) — `EMBED_FILES` not supported by PlatformIO ESP-IDF build
- Calibration validates pitch stddev only — roll singularity at vertical mounting (gz≈0) excluded
- FSM never calls `vTaskDelay()` — all timing via `esp_timer_get_time()`

---

## Phase 4 — Calibration System (verified on real hardware, 2026-04-26)

### Key design decision — pitch-only stddev validation
`roll = atan2(gy, gz)` is numerically unstable when the sensor is vertical
(gz ≈ 0), e.g. mounted on a human back. Even with sensor perfectly still,
roll stddev reads ~11° at 90° mounting due to formula singularity. Pitch
`= atan2(gx, sqrt(gy²+gz²))` has no singularity — stable at every orientation.
Calibration validity check uses pitch stddev only.

### Pass criteria met — verified in both mounting orientations

| Orientation | Cal pitch_stddev | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Flat on desk | 0.38° | ✅ Accepted |
| Vertical (like human back, roll≈90°) | 0.93° | ✅ Accepted |

- Prompt tones → 3s collection → success arpeggio → baseline locked ✅
- Deliberate movement during calibration → fail tone → auto-retry ✅
- Baseline consistent across repeated calibrations ✅

## Phase 3 — I2S + Speaker Output (verified on real hardware, 2026-04-26)

MAX98357A wired to ESP32: BCLK→GPIO26, LRC→GPIO25, DIN→GPIO27, VIN→5V.

### Pass criteria met
- Audible 500Hz boot tone at every power-on — clean, no pop, no distortion ✅
- No I2S error codes in serial log ✅
- IMU angle loop continues normally after tone finishes ✅

### Wiring reference

| MAX98357A Pin | ESP32 Pin |
|---|---|
| VIN | 5V |
| GND | GND |
| BCLK | GPIO 26 |
| LRC (WS) | GPIO 25 |
| DIN | GPIO 27 |
| GAIN | leave floating (9dB) |
| SD | leave floating (always on) |

## Build & Flash

```bash
# Build
pio run

# Flash
pio run --target upload

# Serial monitor
pio device monitor --baud 115200

# Clean rebuild (after sdkconfig changes)
pio run --target clean && pio run
```

## Known Setup Issues (solved)

### ESP-IDF 5.x bootloader overlap
ESP-IDF 5.5.0 bootloader is ~29KB. The default partition table offset `0x8000`
is only 28KB from the bootloader start — causes an overlap error at flash time.
**Fix:** `CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET=0x9000` in `sdkconfig.defaults`.

### Flash size mis-detection
PlatformIO auto-detects 2MB on first run. Board has 4MB.
**Fix:** `board_build.flash_size = 4MB` in `platformio.ini` and
`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE_4MB=y` in `sdkconfig.defaults`.
